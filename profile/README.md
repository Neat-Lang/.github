# The Neat Programming Language

Neat is a C-like programming language, though it's better described as D1 with macros.
This is the umbrella organization for it, containing the compiler, the documentation,
and assorted smaller projects vaguely associated with the project.

Please refer to the language documentation at <https://neat-lang.github.io/>.
